WordPress Comment Counter
=================

A little script that will find the WordPress post with the most comments.

Make sure you stick it in the root of your WordPress install (where the wp-config.php file is)

Simply visit http://url-to-your-wordpress-site/comments.php and voila :)

It also includes a very simple HTML rendering engine that allows you to create divs with IDs and classes etc. within a PHP function aswell as basic formatting such as bolding and headings.

Just CD into your WordPress install and run the following one-liner to download it: ```git clone git@github.com:ShaneCurran/wp-commentcounter.git```

Enjoy :)
